# alevelsubjectallocation
Created a piece of software to give Year 10 girls at my school A level subject taster sessions. 
The languages used in this project were JavaScript, PHP, HTML and CSS. 
I created a series of webpages that were used by my schoolâ€™s administrator to carry out this task.
These files were hosted on my virtual server on my computer with xampp.
The user would open the file login.php, and then progress from here through the webpages. 
For more information, please read the ProgressDescription pdf file.
